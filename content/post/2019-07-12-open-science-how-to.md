## Practical and logistical considerations 

In order to promote the adoption of open science practices, organizational change, particularly from a publication perspective, will be vital. High impact scientific journals will need to begin prioritizing the publication of investigations that have adhered to rigorous open science standards. As well as committing to the publication of pre-registered studies, journals should be encouraged to award researchers with reputation-based incentives for adhering to open science practices.

From a practical perspective, open science will require additional phases of planning prior to investigations, posing potential time inconveniences. This burden will be particularly pronounced for ECRs, who may resent the time required to organize pre-registration plans, particularly in a competitive publication-focused environment. The current culture of research planning will need to adapt to normalize time investments prior, rather than post, investigations, demanding field wide changes to the ‘timeline’ of science.

A crucial consideration when adopting open science practices is how data will be disseminated and protected. Open science principles require registered studies to make study data publicly available to other researchers at the end of the study. This facilitates the re-analysis and possible re-use of data. While data sharing has the potential to increase the speed and accountability of current research practices, this pursuit is not without risk. Data is inherently sensitive; psychological studies in particular may collect individual data of a personal or sensitive nature, requiring careful de-identification before public release. To maximize security, as well as facilitate the hosting of large data files, data should be stored on secure, dedicated file sharing platforms, such as Figshare or OSF. Where published, data should be made as accessible as possible, through the use of informative variable labelling, and by saving data in accessible formats such as .csv or .txt files.

As researchers, data and the publications that follow from them are our livelihood. Understandably, many scientists have raised concerns about the possibility of being ‘scooped’ by competitive researchers. Careful pre-registration records, as well as questions of data ownership, authorship and intellectual property rights must be addressed prior to distributing a data set for researchers to exploit and reuse.
 

## What could we change about our practice to make it more open? Where should we start?  

#### How to Do It: Not a matter of yes or no but rather how much?
   
Open science can be a daunting prospect, especially for early career researchers or those just starting to dip their toes into the open science water. While different people have different views on what it means to practice open science, in the Richmond Lab we are firm believers of taking 'baby steps' (pun not intended) rather than taking no steps at all. As the science tides change and open science gains more and more traction across a variety of disciplines - including Psychology - what can we do as researchers at various levels to push this change along?
 
The following points will cover some core principles discussed in an article written by Spellman, Gilbert & Corker (2017) titled ['Open Science: What, Why and How'](https://osf.io/q4ztd/download) that outlines various ways we can begin incorporating more open science friendly practices in our research.
  
1. Data management
    a. Make it available – Save!
    b. Make it intelligible – Organise, Label & Annotate!
    c. Make it discoverable – Share!
2.    Pre-registering studies
3.    Registered reports
4.    Join a large scale replication project
 
### Data Management

A key part of open science is the data management and organisation side of things - this can often be an element of open science that is overlooked when first starting out. When people hear the phrase ‘open science’ many (including us) think automatically of openly sharing data to enhance transparency in our research practices. However, a core part of this process involves making sure that the data and accompanying information that you are sharing is FAIR. This means that data should be... 

#### FAIR data is...
1. Findable
1. Accessible
1. Interpretable
1. Reusable
 
Following the FAIR guidelines, which can be found [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618),  when it comes to data management and archiving best practices is a good first step. This is key to efficient and meaningful open science - without engaging in at least some of these practices it is hard for others to make sense of your study and the data that comes from it.
 
The next few sections will cover how to align your research practices with open science and the FAIR principles.

 
#### Make it Available - Save
An obvious yet crucial part of engaging in more Open Science practices is to make your data available and accessible when saving. This means trying to use file types that are widely accessible (.csv, .rtf, .txt) so that if you were to share your resources, other researchers would be able to access them without the need for expensive software licenses.
 
We obviously understand this may not be feasible all the time depending on the type of research you do and the software/equipment used, but where possible, try to keep file formats as accessible as possible.
 
#### Make it Intelligible - Organise, Label & Annotate
An equally important step of open science is making sure that you make your data intelligible - organise, label and annotate! Even if you do not plan to share your data, making sure that your data and study materials (including any edits, updates or major revisions) are documented clearly is essential to good research practices in general.
 
There are a various checklists and templates available online that detail different things you may wish to record at different steps of the research process (see Table 3 of Spellman's 2017 article linked at the end of this blog post).
 
Below we provide a general summary of some things to record as part of good research practice that is in line with open science principles.These include:

##### Before data collection
1. Ensuring you have standard operating procedures in the lab -  including naming conventions
1. Power analyses
1 Procedures and protocols (as well as any edits made along the way and annotations explaining why these changes were made)
1. Variables and their explanations
1. Additional information for confirmatory studies - exclusion criteria, hypotheses, analysis plans

##### After data collection
1. Notes about final sample size
1. Anything unusual that occurred

##### After data analyses
1. Annotated analysis script files and data keys
1. Exploratory analyses
 
Depending on the design of your study (e.g., longitudinal or cross-sectional, number of variables measured, protocols across multi-site studies), you may benefit from a version control system that helps to clarify record changes in the research process and dataset. For example - instead of manually saving additional files as 'Protocol Version 1.0/ 2.0/ 2.2', a version control system allows you to have a clear transparent and documented system for tracking a file as it is revised over time.
 
The benefits of having version control system are twofold.
Firstly, having such a system makes it easier for you to keep track of changes within your own study. This in turn reduces the likelihood of errors being carried forward (e.g., an old protocol used rather than the most up to date version).
Secondly, if you choose to share your data and materials, version control systems provide greater transparency regarding changes made to your study throughout the process. This is an important point to keep in mind as many people find the prospect of OS as an 'all or nothing' thing. While there are many OS purists out there, something as simple as organising, labelling and annotating your study materials is a step closer to OS (in our opinion at least).
 
#### Make it Discoverable - Share

Probably one of the more classic hallmarks of open science is sharing your data so that it may be easily accessed by others. It is important to plan what, when and where you are going to share so that you may develop a data management plan accordingly. Public work should state where relevant data and supporting materials are available using stable URLs or other stable digital object identifiers (DOIs).
 
You may be wondering - how much do I actually share?
 
Ultimately, this is up to you as the researcher and different researchers hold different philosophies. On one end of the spectrum, there are those who view themselves as 'data stewards' rather than 'data owners'. From this standpoint, it is not only a preference to make everything available but rather a duty that is necessary to preserving the essence of the scientific process - the process that was borne before problematic incentive structures and the commercialisation of science had become widespread. On the other end of the spectrum, there are open science researchers who will provide only the data and materials that a relevant to reproduce published results. Both of these ends and everything in between constitutes as Open Science (to us at least). It is up to you as an individual researcher as well as part of your wider lab group and/or groups and collaborations to decide to what extent you would like to share your data and materials.
 
Some ways to start thinking about this is asking yourself what values are you trying to uphold by engaging in open science? 

Is it to:

1. Promote greater reliability in research findings by making it easier for replication studies to occur?
1. Disseminate science more broadly and even encourage citizen science among non-professionals?
1. Speed up progress by promoting further collaboration?
 
On a more practical level, below we provide some examples of types of materials you may consider sharing:

1. Study protocols that outline the aims, hypothesis, method, analyses. This includes being specific information about:
  1. Platforms being used for analysis
  1. Relevant analysis codes and direction of hypotheses
  1. Study materials

Ensure that you are citing things correctly, especially publically available materials

Data and metadata:

1. Data - use special repositories for niche research areas
1. Meta-data - data about your data; this includes:
1. Demographic information
1. Code book (ideally in a .txt format) that contains names of variables, links to analysis code and relevant data sets
1. Analysis procedures/codes  (E.g. R Markdown, SPSS syntax)
 
### Pre-registration

Pre-registering confirmatory studies is one of the most common ways to practice open science. Pre-registering a confirmatory study helps prevent against several questionable research practices that inflate the type 1-error rates (i.e., likelihood of false positives). These questionable practices include HARKING (Hypothesising After Results Are Known) and p-hacking whereby researchers run multiple statistical analyses until they achieve a significant result.
 
Pre-registering involves clearly stating your research design and study materials before your data collected begins. This prevents authors from going back and making adjustments to how they report their methodology in order to fit the data they have collected, or reporting exploratory findings as confirmatory after the fact.

There are different ways to register your studies including...

1. Pre-registration  
- where you specify your research design (including study materials)
2. Pre-registration +
- whereby in addition to your research design, you also provide planned statistical analyses (for confirmatory research). Note that these do not have to be directional hypotheses but can just specifically outline the statistical tests a priori.
 
When you pre-register your study details, you are provided with a verified timestamp on all the materials uploaded. For those of you concerned about getting scooped (see next section for more information), there is the option to place embargos on your study details so that you can make them private and release them at a later time. 
Depending on the platform you use, the option to have your pre-registered details embargoed can vary (e.g., on the Open Science Framework, you can place up to a 4 year embargo after which the details will automatically be made public whereas on AsPredicted.org you are able to place an embargo on the details indefinitely if you wish).
 
#### But What if I get Scooped?
 
The likelihood of being scooped is widely overestimated but it makes sense that is a concern for a good proportion of researchers. You pour your time and effort into a project so you are understandably a bit protective of that work. However, open science can actually be beneficial in both communicating and carving out your own research space while also opening up opportunities to collaborate and gaining you more citations (yay!).

Pre-registering studies and sharing that information provides you with an opportunity to be like "Hey, this is what I'm already doing / about to do…". This in itself can often dissuade researchers who are much earlier on in the research process that may have wanted to examine a similar question. Similarly, by pre-registering and sharing study information, researchers with similar research interests are more likely to reach out and offer collaborations. This allows for the merging of expertise to make for a richer scientific process. Finally, by making your data available, you are more likely to be cited if researchers go on to use your dataset for their respective studies.
 
### Registered Reports
Registered reports are another way to engage in the practice of open science. This process helps to protect against confirmation bias since reviewers conduct a thorough review of a research plan prior to data collection in order to establish that the study is well-designed, fair and is examining a relevant research question.
 
Based on the research plans, the study can be provisionally accepted for publication based on the soundness of the study aims, design, hypotheses, methods and analytic approach rather than their results. This in turn helps to combat the **file-drawer problem**, in which only significant and sensationalist findings get published while 'less sexy' findings are filed away or rejected by reviewers. The following link takes you to a [webpage](https://cos.io/rr/?_ga=1.62517349.85780) that summarises Registered Reports and outlines how you may engage in this process.
 
 
### Participate in a Large Scale Replication Project
Finally, in addition to adopting Open Science principles when conducting your own, novel research studies - getting involved in a large-scale replication project (e.g., Many Labs, Many Babies) is a hands on way to get involved in the open science movement. Big research groups are always looking for people to sign on and ‘fight the good fight’ so to speak.
 
### Conclusion
If you have made it to the end of this blog post – good job! :purple_heart: While the process of Open Science can sometimes feel a bit overwhelming, we are firm believers that something is better than nothing and the fact that you’re even looking into open science (as evidenced by you reading this blog post) means you are already one step closer to engaging in open science.
