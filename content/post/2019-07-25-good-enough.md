honest authentic genuine 

just starting or expert, nice to see

Expect something better message- believe in the power of other people, there are other people that have been in the same situation who have solved your problem

If no one in my lab knows, then Ill have to do it the other way 

Field differences, becasue no one knows in psychology it is easier to ask for help. 

sharing before it is perfect- the internet makes it easy

# Data management
- document the process of raw to ready to analyse data, making sure that the intermediate phases are clear
- work with tidy data, it makes analysis easier 

- keep the raw data (dont be tempted to overwrite it will clean data)
- back it up (in more than one place)
3. create the data you with to see in the world 
-    think about times you have been sent data, what did you want it to look like? 
-    think about both machine and human readibility, format (csv is a good option), variable names that are meaningful, missing data that is coded as NA rather than -99
- use the filename to store metadata (i.e. 2016-05-alaska-b.csv)
4. create analysis friendly data
- tidy data is easier to work with
- each column is a variable
- each row is an observation

90%."
