Julia Lowndes is an environmental scientist who works with the Ocean Health Index and was invited to give a [keynote at the userR conference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8PqwFPqn6Y) in Toulouse about her work promoting reproducible data science. Her talk was called **"R for better science in less time"** 


Much like psychologists, environmental scientists aren't taught how to work with data, so they learn the hard way. The Ocean Health index did it incrementally (as Brian Nosek also suggests) first adding R and Rstudio to their workflow, then git and github, tidy data principles, and finally communication with RMarkdown. 

The result was more reproducible science with easier collaboration (even with their future selves).

Scientists don't think of themselves as data scientists; Julia argues that it is worth reworking the definition to include scientists.

> Data science = the discpline of turning raw data into understanding


We really liked the idea that open science is a spectrum. By considering it a journey that you can start on with relatively small changes in behaviour, it breaks down the mindset that you are either doing it or not. 

You can start by...

- sharing the slides from a presentation
- work as a team with git, even just within you group and those repositories re private

----- these things count 

R is great because you can use the same tools to do analysis and communication.


> Teamwork starts with openness; working openly, vertical/horizontal leadership, community 

You dont need to be an expert before you can champion the process with others. Create time aside to work on something that benefits everyone.
